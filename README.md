The files in this repository are not in a proper order. I used these scripts to understand the usefullness of NILM for identifying 
anomalous appliances. Since, it is hard to record real-anomalies. So, I inserted anomalies manually in several appliances of six different
homes (4 dataport, 1 Iawe, and 1 Redd). The appliances in which I inserted the anomalies are mentioned in 
nilmtk_pycharm/inserted_anomalies_home_wise.py file. This file also shows the timestamps at which anomalies were inserted.
