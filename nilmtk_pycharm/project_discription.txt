LBM: 
1. Population models are obtained from file LBM_features_main.py and this file is stored in AD of UniOfStra project. This is stored in different folder becuase all coding is done in python 3 while the current project works in python 2.7. Since the core LBM is in python 2.7
2. Obtain population models from above step and then use LBM_disaggregation_error.py to compute normalized disaggregation for each appliance of a home 

07-January 2018:
1. F-SCORE,PRECISION AND RECALL for OMNI: To compute anomaly scores at aggregate level, we use OMNI algorithm along with few baselines. This is done in main_function_offline.R stored in R_support folder of this directory. For seconds level data, I use replica of same file in order to handle all things clearly and the file name is main_function_offline_iaweRedd.R
2. All plots in buildys 2017 paper are plotted usin R script with name plot_Results.R
3. F_score, precison and recall of UNUM on AC, fridge: Use oracle_disagg_main script and  "localize_main_context...." to get anomalies detected using non disaggregated and  disaggregated appliance data and store results in files. Next use results_visualization.R, which is R script to compute required metrics

11-January 2018: [PLOTTING]
Complete details how to plot the results

1. F-score at aggregate level: Use plot_results.R in R directory
2. Disaggregation accuarcy: use plot_results.R
3. F-score at appliance level: use plot_results.R

Insights plots: These plots in the paper are drawn in plots_eEnergy2018.R

Tables showing missing anomalies for OMNI and UNUM:
follow below procedure
 UNUM TABLE:
1. Read files corresponding to homes in the directory "/Volumes/MacintoshHD2/Users/haroonr/Dropbox/nilmtk_work/inter_results/oracle/" to get results of UNUM on submetered data
2. Next read the file "inserted_anomlies_home_wise" placed in nilmtk_pycharm folder to get the actual inserted anomalies
3. Now compare results of step 1 and 2 and compute table entries

OMNI TABLE:
1. Read file named as "energy_score.csv" stored in the folder corresponding to each home with home name on path "/Volumes/MacintoshHD2/Users/haroonr/Dropbox/nilmtk_work/inter_results/"
2.  Next read the file "inserted_anomlies_home_wise" placed in nilmtk_pycharm folder to get the actual inserted anomalies
3. Now compare results of step 1 and 2 and compute table entries
