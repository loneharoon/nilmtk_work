LBM: 
1. Population models are obtained from file LBM_features_main.py and this file is stored in AD of UniOfStra project. This is stored in different folder becuase all coding is done in python 3 while the current project works in python 2.7. Since the core LBM is in python 2.7
2. Obtain population models from above step and then use LBM_disaggregation_error.py to compute normalized disaggregation for each appliance of a home

1. F-SCORE,PRECISION AND RECALL for OMNI: To compute anomaly scores at aggregate level, we use OMNI algorithm along with few baselines. This is done in main_function_offline.R stored in R_support folder of this directory. For seconds level data, I use replica of same file in order to handle all things clearly and the file name is main_function_offline_iaweRedd.R
2. All plots in buildys 2017 paper are plotted usin R script with name plot_Results.R
3. F_score, precison and recall of UNUM on AC, fridge: Use oracle_disagg_main script and  "localize_main_context...." to get anomalies detected using non disaggregated and  disaggregated appliance data and store results in files. Next use results_visualization.R, which is R script to compute required metrics
